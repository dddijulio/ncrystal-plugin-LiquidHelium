ncrystal-plugin-LiquidHeliumData
================================================

Plugin for NCrystal, which provides the user with extra NCMAT data files for Liquid Helium at specific temperatures.

After installation, use for instance nctool --browse to see the provided file names. For instance, to use the material at 1.3K, one would use a cfg-string like "plugins::LiquidHeliumData/LiquidHelium_T1.3K.ncmat".

Available temperatures are listed below.

1.3 K: This NCMAT file was generated using the approach described in [1] and the model used includes both single-phonon and multi-phonon extications.
